                    The sandbar is submerged in the water during high tide but emerges during low tide. Native wooden houses on stilts are scattered across the sandbar. During high tide, the houses seem to be floating on the water. The combination of the white sand, clear water, and blue sky make Manjuyod Sandbar a spectacular natural attraction.

                    Manjuyod is a usual stop of a day trip itinerary that also involves island hopping in the Philippines and dolphin watching. It is common for boats full of tourists to hover around the sandbar area and wait for low tide. Local vendors on boats come to sell snacks, drinks, and seafood to waiting tourists.

                    You also have the option to stay overnight on this famous sandbar by renting one of the wooden houses in Manjuyod Sandbar tours. An overnight stay gives you the experience of living in the middle of the open sea. You will need to take a 15-minutes boat ride from Bais City to reach Manjuyod Sandbar.
