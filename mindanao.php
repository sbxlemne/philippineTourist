                    Cloud 9 is recognized as one of the world’s best surfing destinations. It is even ranked as one of the top ten waves worldwide, where international surfing competitions are often held. Beginners can watch the pros showcase their skills and limits. Siargao is also a good choice for couples who want to have their honeymoon in the Philippines.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                    The ideal time to go to Siargao is from September to November. Surfers can ride waves as high as 8 feet up to 12 feet. There are also surf schools around the area that offer beginner, intermediate, and advanced surf courses. Surf camps in Siargao usually last a week, which already include surf rental equipment and instruction. Read our guide to surfing in Siargao to learn more.

                    There is probably no other river in the country that will surpass the blueness of the famous Enchanted River, another mystic gem nestled in Hinatuan town in Surigao del Sur. It is 290 meters long, but its depth remains a mystery for many divers.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                    There were diving expeditions made in the past, yet there is no clear picture of what lies at the bottommost part of the mystical river. With water flowing to the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean, the Hinatuan Enchanted River opens up to an estuary where salt water mixes with the river’s spring water.

                    <p>
                    The famous blue river is only a small portion of it. Divers even found an opening of an underwater cave at the river’s deepest portion. To preserve its beauty, visitors are not allowed to swim in the main pool. There is a designated area for swimming, which is only 10 meters away from the main pool.

                    Cagayan De Oro (CDO) is known as the whitewater rafting capital of the Philippines. Among the many extreme sports in CDO, whitewater rafting is the most popular one for adrenaline junkies. It takes place along the Cagayan River, which spans up to 48 kilometers with over 59 rapids. The best time to try this sport is from July to December when the water current is strong.

                    <p>
                    Whitewater rafting usually takes around 5 hours, and you need a lot of arm strength to paddle and face the turbulent waves. This wet and wild ride will take you through huge rock formations between lush mangrove forests. Throughout the ride, a professional river guide will accompany you.

                    One of the majestic sights in the Surfing Capital of the Philippines, Siargao Island, is the Magpupungko Rock Pools. It has a stunning tidal rock pool with crystal clear emerald waters surrounded by striking rock formations. This crown jewel is only accessible during the low tide and is not visible when the tides are high.

                    Magpupungko Rock Pools is only a 45-minute drive away or 35KM away from the center of General Luna. The best way to enjoy the tide pools is to go cliff diving into its 3-meter deep refreshing blue waters. It is situated near Magpupungko Beach with towering coconut trees that offer adequate shade.

                    Another underrated yet must-visit place in the northeast of Mindanao is the Dinagat Islands. This emerging attraction in Surigao del Norte features secluded beaches, waterfalls, caves, and panoramic mountain views.

                    One of the must-see spots you wouldn’t want to miss in Dinagat Islands is its mystical Lake Bababu. It is a meromictic lake, which contains both saltwater and freshwater. Another interesting thing about the lake is its 650-meter long and 2,200-feet deep underwater cave, the longest one in the Philippines. It connects scuba divers from the lake to the open sea.
