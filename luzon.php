                    From a stroll in the city in the previous entry, the next spot is an exhilarating and challenging hike up a 1500-meter-high attraction. The Batad Banaue Rice Terraces in Ifugao, Cordillera Region, which is more than 600 km from Manila, is a man-made, stair-like rice paddy that follows the steep slopes of the mountainside. It was also included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995.

                    The intricate irrigation system of the Batad Rice Terraces allows it to still be used up to this day. To see the beauty of this old-time human ingenuity, you will have an hour-long hike up to the village of Batad. The panoramic views of pristine, unsoiled forestry will greet you next.

                    <p>
                    Going on an El Nido Palawan tour will seem like you've been transported from the best resorts in El Nido to an ethereal fantasy world, but you're only gazing at one of the most fabled top tourist destination in the Philippines.

                    Great things come in small packages, and that rings true for the island province of Batanes, one of the best provinces to visit in Luzon. Located on the northernmost part of Luzon and accessible only by plane with limited flights to and from Manila, the province of Batanes holds some of the most breath-taking scenic views the country has to offer.

                    <p>
                    One of the notable sites, and possibly one of the favorites in Batanes tours, is the Vayang Rolling Hills. Here you'll have an unobstructed view of Mt. Iraya as well as the three main islands of Batan, Sabtang, and Itbayat. The gentle green slopes of Vayang paint a vibrant complement to the bright blue waters of the West Philippine Sea.

                    <p>

                    There are daily direct flights to Puerto Princesa from Manila. Alternatively, you can travel by sea but note that this route would take you over a day to get there. Upon arrival, you can arrange for a local transfer to Honda Bay via tricycle, which will take an additional 30-minute journey.
